# Introduction

I earned my doctorate from the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), in July 2023. I now serve as an Tenure-Track Associate Professor at the IIE. My research primarily focuses on critical issues in cybersecurity, encompassing IoT security, cloud computing security, and access control security. I have a particular interest in identifying and understanding new design flaws and inconsistencies in real-world systems.
